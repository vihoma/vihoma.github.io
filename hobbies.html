      <p>
          I have <strong>computers and software</strong> as a hobby and I run
          at the moment just one machine, my desktop and workstation:<br>
          <strong>#1</strong> <u>A Jimm's Business Class President</u>
          (assembled initially in Jimm's PC Store) Xeon E3-1230v3 3,3GHz, 32GB
          RAM, 250GB Samsung EVO SSD main OS &amp; software storage, 1TB
          Western Digital Caviar Black HDD, Asus RoG STRIX GTX 1060 OC 6GB GPU,
          additional Gigabit PCI-e Intel Pro Desktop NIC for networking instead
          of the default mainboard NIC, and a Dell U3415W 34" Ultawide QHD
          display, OS: Windows 10 Professional.<br>
          <strong>The rest are history or not currently in use:</strong><br>
          <strong>#2</strong> A Raspberry Pi 3 B running Unbound, a forwarding
          DNS server for my LAN and for Irssi (IRC client), OS: Raspbian
          (latest stable release, "Stretch" at the moment);<br>
          <strong>#3</strong> A now removed LibVirt/KVM VM with a Ubuntu 14.04
          LTS based NIDS/HIDS/NSM/SIEM distro named
          <a href="https://securityonion.net/" target="_blank">Security Onion</a>.
          Has 4 3.3GHz Haswsell-NoTSX cores, 12GB RAM, 500GB raw-format virtio
          bus mass storage and two virtualized &amp; brigded Intel Pro GBE NICs,
          one for network connection, the other dedicated for packet sniffing.
          Has for example Suricata, Bro, Netsniff-NG (pcap), OSSEC, Sguild, ELSA
          and other network security tools and web-based user interfaces for
          monitoring and analysis. I also connect with Sguil from my workstation
          for SIEM (I guess that's what it is called?);<br>
          <strong>#4</strong> A LibVirt/KVM VM with OpenBSD-stable for Unbound,
          a forwarding DNS server for my LAN. Has 1 3.3GHz Haswell-NoTSX core,
          512MB RAM, 8GB qcow2-format with virtio bus mass storage and bridged
          virtio networking;<br>

      <p>
          The mentioned virtual machines ran 24/7, suspending on workstation
          shutdowns and reboots and resuming at workstations OS boot.
          <strong>This was when I had Ubuntu LTS as my workstarion OS.</strong>
          I haven't tried Microsoft Hyper-V yet, but do have a Debian userland
          installed under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for a SSH connection
          to a shell server running Irssi for using IRC. Locally in Debian under
          WSL I use Vim in its more native environment with jedi-python and other 
          addons for hobbyist and practise for studies Python development.
			</p>
      <p> 
          <strong>#5, 486SX</strong> worked before as a firewall/router for my
          ADSL-connection, afterwards it became my LAN's secondary nameserver
          (<strong>just because I can ;)</strong>) and it was running fine
          until I took the little devil offline, but after a while I took it
          back to use as the DNS server on my LAN. Well, now it was time for
          it's original 100MB hard drive to fail after a long power outage
          which my UPS couldn't handle and forced a shutdown. It is sitting
          in my stereo rack unused and silently for now :'(
			</p>
      <p>
          I also play a little with other <strong>virtual machines</strong>,
          having guest operating system like Minix, FreeBSD or FreeDOS. I test
          whatever perks my interest from the world of open source operating
          systems. Learning more about OpenSolaris-based distributions is on
          my list also, I have done some testing with OmniOS in the past and
          it seemed like a decent UNIX for server deployment, but this is just
          a preliminary impression.

      <p>
          <strong>Archery</strong> is a new hobby of mine and I joined
          <a href="http://www.puijonjousi.fi">Puijo Archery Club</a>, (or in
          Finnish "<strong>Puijon Jousi ry</strong>") in April 2018. I shoot a
          budget friendly target compound bow, a
          <a href="https://diamondarchery.com/bows/medalist-38/">Diamond
              Archery Medalist 38</a>. For now I've found archery to be very
          relaxing, enhancing my focus at least for the time I'm shooting and
          for some time after a practice session. When all goes well one can
          find a really calm place while shooting, it's like there's nothing
          else but the excersise and even the missed or failed shots go by and
          a new arrow takes flight. I'm starting to get a hand of the form,
          instinctive release and such! I also feel my posture has become
          better, i can keep my shoulders with poise. Archery definately helps
          with posture, one needs to use the muscles in ones back (core
          muscles). Only "problem" I had with this hobby was aching fingers
          and finger joints from pulling the arrows from the target backings
          made from laminated rubber foam. The arrows seem to burn tightly and
          deep to the backing, no matter if I apply some silicone to them or
          not, so an arrow puller is a must it seems (which I've acquired now
          and it <strong>helps</strong>). I think I
          <strong>finally found</strong> a hobby which i can enjoy for the
          rest of my life with joy, improvements and interest. What a rush
          this archery is for me!
      </p>
      <p>
        I also need arrows for my bow, these are
        <a href="https://www.goldtip.com/Target/Pierce-Tour/Kinetic-Pierce-Target.aspx">
        Gold Tip Kinetic Pierce Target</a> spine 400 with nock pins and Easton
        G pin nocks, nock collars, 140gr TopHat points and 50mm low profile
        XS Wings spin vaness. Other stuff I have for my bow are a Sure Loc
        Challenger 550 sight, a Mybo Ten Zone scope with a 0.75 diopter lens
        with a green 0.029" pin and a Ripcord X-Factor blade rest with a narrow
        0.008" "Best" launcher blade. I also have a narrow 0.010" stiffness
        blade which may or may not be better, will see if I'll get to fine
        tuning my bow. Also need a quiver to keep my arrows while shooting, an
        Easton QH-100 Hip Quiver in red and black. A release aid is useful with
        a compound bow, I've got two handheld type with the same anchor and
        point of impact, a Tru-Fire Synapse thumb button and a Tru-Fire Sear
        hinge. I need to move the bow safely and For that I've got a Legend
        Everest 44 compound bow case which includes a Legend arrow tube inside
        for safe arrow transport.
      </p>

      <p>
          I <strong>listen to a wide range of musical genres</strong> from Black
          Metal to Classical, Techno and Ambient. My audio gear is comprised of
          Yamaha NX-N500 active speaker pair, a Cambridge Audio DACmagic XS USB
          DAC/headphone amp and Bose QuietComfort 35 II headphones.
			</p>

      <p>
          From <strong>Sci-fi</strong> movies my favorites are for example
          Bladerunner, Minority Report and Star Wars (especially the three last
          and oldest episodes). Movies based on Philip K. Dick's novels and
          short stories are always to my liking. From series I've watched Star
          Treks, Babylon 5, Stargates, Eureka, Farscape etc. Most of the time my
          video player is mpv.
			</p>

      <p>
          I <strong>program</strong> with Java,  Perl, Python and POSIX sh, for
          web sites also a little with PHP (not really, I've forgotten that ;D).
          Still, I'm just a beginner or intermediate in all these languages.
          <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>shell scripting</strong> skills are
          my strongest point.
			</p>

	  	<p>
          I <strong>read</strong> mainly IT literature if I can. "Sinuhe the
          Egyptian", or just "The Egyptian" in Finnish from Mika Waltari is in
          my never-will-finish readings...
	  	</p>

	  	<p>
          If you are interested in learning Perl programming, then I suggest
          you read <strong>Learning Perl</strong> book from O'Reilly, very fun
          and interesting basic Perl programming guidebook.

          I was participating in <strong>Folding@Home</strong> with my Xeon
          workstation, statistics at the bottom of this page.
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
          <strong>E-cigarettes</strong>, well, i stopped smoking years ago and
          turned to E-cigarettes (no tar, no carbon monoxide and all the other
          carcinogens). You'll see my stats on that too at the bottom of this
          page.
