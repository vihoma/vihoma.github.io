          I have <strong>computers</strong> as a hobby and I own &amp; run at
          the moment four machines:<br>
          <strong>#1</strong> <u>A Jimm's Business Class President</u>
          (assembled initially in Jimm's PC Store) Xeon E3-1230v3 3,3GHz, 32GB
          RAM, 250GB Samsung EVO SSD storage, 1TB Western Digital Caviar Black
          HDD, Asus RoG STRIX GTX 1060 OC 6GB GPU, additional Gigabit PCI-e
          Intel Pro Desktop NIC dedicated for network packet sniffing with the
          Security Onion VM, and a Dell U3415W 34" Ultawide QHD display, OS:
          Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Runs 24/7 and has some Virtual Machines with
          services always-on;<br>
          <!--<strong>#2</strong> AMD Athlon64 3200+, 1024MB RAM, 20GB HDD, PNY
          Quadro 600 1GB GPU, OS: Ubuntu 16.04 (in text-mode);<br>
          <strong>#3</strong> ICL 486SX (with a 487 math-coprocessor) 33MHz,
          8MB RAM, 100MB HDD, OS: NetBSD 2.0_RC4 (headless).-->
          <strong>#2</strong> A Raspberry Pi 3 B running Unbound, a forwarding
          DNS server for my LAN and for Irssi (IRC client), OS: Raspbian
          (latest stable release, "Stretch" at the moment);<br>
          <strong>#3</strong> A LibVirt/KVM VM with a Ubuntu 14.04 LTS based
          NIDS/HIDS/NSM/SIEM distro named
          <a href="https://securityonion.net/" target="_blank">Security Onion</a>.
          Has 4 3.3GHz Haswsell-NoTSX cores, 12GB RAM, 500GB raw-format virtio
          bus mass storage and two virtualized &amp; brigded Intel Pro GBE NICs,
          one for network connection, the other dedicated for packet sniffing.
          Has for example Suricata, Bro, Netsniff-NG (pcap), OSSEC, Sguild, ELSA
          and other network security tools and web-based user interfaces for
          monitoring and analysis. I also connect with Sguil from my workstation
          for SIEM (I guess that's what it is called?);<br>
          <strong>#4</strong> A LibVirt/KVM VM with OpenBSD-stable for Unbound,
          a forwarding DNS server for my LAN. Has 1 3.3GHz Haswell-NoTSX core,
          512MB RAM, 8GB qcow2-format with virtio bus mass storage and bridged
          virtio networking;<br>
      </p>
      <p>
          The mentioned virtual machines run 24/7, suspending on workstation
          shutdowns and reboots and resuming at workstations OS boot
      </p>
      <p>
          The underlined <strong>#1, Business Class President</strong> is
          currently my desktop and "workstation", used to participate in
          Folding@Home.<br>
          <strong>#5, 486SX</strong> worked before as a firewall/router for my
          ADSL-connection, afterwards it became my LAN's secondary nameserver
          (<strong>just because I can ;)</strong>) and it was running fine
          until I took the little devil offline, but after a while I took it
          back to use as the DNS server on my LAN. Well, now it was time for
          it's original 100MB hard drive to fail after a long power outage
          which my UPS couldn't handle and forced a shutdown. It is sitting
          in my stereo rack unused and silently for now :'(
      </p>
      <p>
          I also play a little with other <strong>virtual machines</strong>,
          having guest operating system like Minix, FreeBSD or FreeDOS. I test
          whatever perks my interest from the world of open source operating
          systems. Learning more about OpenSolaris-based distributions is on
          my list also, I have done some testing with OmniOS in the past and
          it seemed like a decent UNIX for server deployment, but this is just
          a preliminary impression.
      </p>

      <p>
          <strong>Archery</strong> is a new hobby of mine and I joined
          <a href="http://www.puijonjousi.fi">Puijo Archery Club</a>, (or in
          Finnish "<strong>Puijon Jousi ry</strong>") in April 2018. I didn't
          hesitate to get myself a hunting compound bow before even joining the
          club and without asking the local archers about choosing a suitable
          bow, silly me ;) Well, I'm content with my choise, a black
          <a href="https://diamondarchery.com/bows/edge-sb-1-2/">
              Diamond Edge SB-1
          </a> set to 29.5" draw length and 45lb draw weight. Will be upgrading
          the arrow shelf, now a basic Octane Hostage designed for hunting, to
          a target shooters shelf once I get a hang of the form, the bow, the
          draw and the release.<br/>
          <strong>New target bow!!!</strong>, a red
          <a href="https://diamondarchery.com/bows/medalist-38/">
              Diamond Medalist 38
          </a>, sold the Diamond Edge SB-1 and got a new rig, with equipment
          designed for target archery like the arrow rest, sight, scope,
          stabilizers and a smaller interchangeable diameter peep sight. This
          thing helps me shoot more consistent and accurate for sure, not
          underminding the archers part in the process though! Anyways, scores
          especially at 50m for 60 arrows have improved by take or leave 150
          points after the swap to this new bow and other rig i got with it.
          For now I've found archery to be very relaxing, enhancing my focus at
          least for the time I'm shooting and for some time after a practice
          session. When all goes well one can find a really calm place while
          shooting, it's like there's nothing else but the excersise and even
          the missed or failed shots go by and a new arrow takes flight.I also
          feel my posture has become better, i can keep my shoulders with poise.
          Archery definately helps with posture, one needs to use the muscles at
          and around scapulae. Only "problem" I had with this hobby was aching
          fingers and finger joints from pulling the arrows from the target
          backings made from laminated rubber foam. Even at 45lb the arrows seem
          to burn tightly and deep to the backing, no matter if I apply some
          silicone to them or not, so an arrow puller is a must it seems (which
          I've acquired now and it <strong>helps</strong>). I think I
          <strong>finally found</strong> a hobby which i can enjoy for the rest
          of my life with joy and interest. What a rush this archery is for me!
      </p>

      <p>
          I <strong>listen to a wide range of musical genres</strong> from Black
          Metal to Classical and Ambient. My audio gear is comprised of Yamaha
          NX-N500 active speaker pair, a Cambridge Audio DACmagic XS USB
          DAC/headphone amp and AKG K702 headphones.
      </p>

      <p>
          From <strong>Sci-fi</strong> movies my favorites are for example
          Bladerunner, Minority Report and Star Wars (especially the three last
          and oldest episodes). Movies based on Philip K. Dick's novels and
          short stories are always to my liking. From series I've watched Star
          Treks, Babylon 5, Stargates, Eureka, Farscape etc. Most of the time my
          video player is mpv.
      </p>

      <p>
          I <strong>program</strong> with Java,  Perl, Python and POSIX sh, for
          web sites also a little with PHP (not really, I've forgotten that ;D).
          Still, I'm just a beginner or intermediate in all these languages.
          <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>shell scripting</strong> skills are
          my strongest point.
      </p>

	  <p>
          I <strong>read</strong> mainly IT literature if I can. "Sinuhe the
          Egyptian", or just "The Egyptian" in Finnish from Mika Waltari is in
          my never-will-finish readings...
	  </p>

	  <p>
          If you are interested in learning Perl programming, then I suggest
          you read <strong>Learning Perl</strong> book from O'Reilly, very fun
          and interesting basic Perl programming guidebook.

          I'm participating at the moment in <strong>Folding@Home</strong>
          with my Xeon workstation, statistics at the bottom of this page.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
          <strong>E-cigarettes</strong>, well, i stopped smoking years ago and
          turned to E-cigarettes (no tar, no carbon monoxide and all the other
          carcinogens). You'll see my stats on that too at the bottom of this
          page.
