<h3>Hi!</h3>
<p>
This is mine, Marko Vihoma's personal homepage. On these pages I'll
introduce myself by my <a href="hobbies.html">hobbies</a>,
<a href="studies.html">studies</a> and got some silly
<a href="images.html">images &amp; photos</a> and really old
<a href="code.html">code samples</a>. Here's also my
<a href="contact.html">contact info</a> if you need it.<br>
I was born in 1977 and at the moment i study computer sciences/software
engineering (bachelor's degree as an aim) as my major at the University
of Eastern Finland. I am also on disability pension because of
persistent, treatment resistant deep depression, and also because of,
<strong>wtf</strong>, delusional disorder <strong>XD</strong>. On the
other hand I believe, as do others, that I've got a non-treated ADD and
was ADHD as a child which has contributed at least to my depression.
<br>
This site was my final work for Savonia University of Applied Sciences
"Making Web Pages" -course and then transformed to a
<a href="http://groundwork.sidereel.com/">GroundworkCSS</a> testing
project.
